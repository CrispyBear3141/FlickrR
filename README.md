# FlickrR

This is a short R script that extracts photos as well as associated metadata.This code leverages the flickr.photos.search API to obtain the photo information as well as the flickr.people.getInfo API to obtain the photographer's information. The script will create a folder named after the keyword in a preset working directory, download the photos (named after their respective IDs) and returns a CSV file with the metadata.

This code was written referrencing the works of https://github.com/FrancescaMancini/Flickr-APIFlickr-API and https://github.com/jimhester/flickrr.
